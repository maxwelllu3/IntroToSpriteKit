 ## Positioning Sprites
 
 Immediately below is the code we first explored on the prior page.
 
 Read past this section of code to learn how to create and position sprites.

// Required frameworks
import PlaygroundSupport    // Allows playground to show live view
import SpriteKit            // Provides 2D graphics classes

// Define the animation size and scene

 ### What is a sprite?
 
 Sprites can take the the form of abstract shapes – for example, via an instance of `SKShapeNode`.
 
 More commonly, sprites are created from the `SKSpriteNode` class and based on a bitmap image you provide.
 
 This means that sprites in your games or animations can be images you find online, or images you create yourself (for example, using an iPad, or by scanning hand-drawn images).
 
 - Callout(Explore):
 Click the disclosure triangle for this playground page. Do the same for the **Resources** subfolder. What do you see?
 
 ![disclosure](disclosure.png)
 
 Let's create a few sprites using images from the **Resources** folder.
 */

// Create and position a sprite at the origin, using the "circle.png" image
let circle = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "circle")
circle.position = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0)

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Run the playground now. What do you notice? What is the node count?
 
 It's not enough to simply create an instance of the `SKSpriteNode` class. For the sprite to appear, it must be added to the scene.
 
 - Experiment:
    Uncomment the line of code below.
    
    Observe the change to the node count.
 
    What does the position of the sprite tell you about the location of the origin in a SpriteKit scene?
 
    What does the appearance of the circle tell you about where a sprite is "anchored"?
 
 */

//scene.addChild(circle)

/*:
 
 You can add many sprites based on the same image file.
 
 - Experiment:
    Uncomment the blocks of code below, one block at a time. Run the playground after uncommenting each block.
 
Remember that you can select a block of code by positioning your cursor at the left edge of the first line, then hold down the **Shift** key, then press the **↓** key.
 
Once you have selected the block of code, press the **Command** and / keys at the same time to toggle the comments off all at once.

//// Add another circle to the right of the origin
//let circle2 = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "circle")
//circle2.position = CGPoint(x: 100, y: 0)
//scene.addChild(circle2)

//// Add another circle further above the origin
//let circle3 = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "circle")
//circle3.position = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 200)
//scene.addChild(circle3)

//// Add a circle at the bottom right corner of the scene
//let circle4 = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "circle")
//circle4.position = CGPoint(x: scene.size.width, y: 0)
//scene.addChild(circle4)

//// Add a star at the right side of the scene, halfway up
//let star = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "star")
//star.position = CGPoint(x: scene.size.width, y: scene.size.height / 2)
//scene.addChild(star)

/*:
 - Callout(Reflect):
     Does the co-ordinate system for a SpriteKit scene work like you expected?
 
 ### Exercises
 
 Write code to complete each of the following tasks.
 
 1. Add a star to the scene, centred vertically and horizontally.
 2. Add a circle to the top right corner of the scene.
 3. Add a square to the scene, centred horizontally, and at the very top of the scene.
