//: ### Required libraries
import PlaygroundSupport    // Allows playground to show live view
import SpriteKit            // Provides 2D graphics classes


/*:
 ### Initial scene setup
 Here we define the size and background color of the scene.
 */
// Define the size of the animation
let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 400, height: 320)

// Set the midpoint of the scene to the centre of the frame
let midpoint = CGPoint(x: frame.size.width / 2, y: frame.size.height / 2)

// Create an instance of SKScene to contain our game / animation
var scene = SKScene(size: frame.size)

/*:
 ### Present the scene
 For UIKit projects you have usually created views on a storyboard in Interface Builder.
 
 Here, we create a view in code instead, and then show that view in the playground's live view area.
 */
// Create a view – an instance of the SKView class
let view = SKView(frame: frame)

PlaygroundSupport.PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = view

/*:
 ### Define and add sprites
 
 Sprites can take the the form of abstract shapes – for example, via an instance of `SKShapeNode`.
 
 More commonly, sprites are created from the `SKSpriteNode` class and based on a bitmap image you provide.
 
 This means sprites in your games or animations can be images you find online, or images you create yourself (for example, using an iPad, or by scanning hand-drawn images).
 */

// Make a four sprites (nodes) of various shapes

// 1. A square
let square = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "square")
/*:
 - Callout(Naming nodes):
 By [naming nodes with the same identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/1483136-name) we can later "find" and "do something with" all nodes that share this identifer. More on this later.

                          y: scene.size.height * 0.50)      // Left side

// 2. A circle

 ### Physics bodies
 One of the huge benefits that SpriteKit offers is a built-in physics engine.
 
 That might sound complicated. It's simple, though – all you need to understand is that you can tell SpriteKit how you want a node to move (velocity), whether you want it to slow down (due to friction), and whether it is affected by gravity.
 
 To have nodes be affected by the SpriteKit physics, we must define *bodies*, or edges, for the nodes.

### More about physics bodies
"The circle body is a **dynamic** physics body — that is, it moves. It’s solid, has mass and can collide with any other type of physics body. The physics simulation can apply various forces to move volume-based bodies."

"The edge loop body is a **static** volume-less physics body — that is, it does not move. As the name implies, an edge loop only defines the edges of a shape. It doesn’t have mass, cannot collide with other edge loop bodies and is never moved by the physics simulation. Other objects can be inside or outside its edges."

"The most common use for an edge loop body is to define collision areas to describe your game’s boundaries, ground, walls, trigger areas or any other type of unmoving collision space."

    let decimal = Float(randomValue) / Float(UInt32.max)
    
    // Scale the decimal value to the range between max and min
    let scaled = CGFloat(decimal) * (max - min)
