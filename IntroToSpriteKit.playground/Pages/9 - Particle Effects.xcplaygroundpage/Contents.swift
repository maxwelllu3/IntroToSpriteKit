 ## Particle Effects
 
 The scene below sets up a basic scene with a black background.

 A character from an old video game is positioned in the lower left corner.
 
 Read past this code to learn how particle effects can be used to add some "sizzle" to your SpriteKit animations.

 ### Adding a Particle Emitter Node
 
 From the [developer documentation on `SKEmitterNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skemitternode):
 
 A *particle emitter* "is a node that automatically creates and renders small particle sprites. Particles are privately owned by SpriteKit—your game cannot access the generated sprites. For example, you cannot add physics shapes to particles. Emitter nodes are often used to create smoke, fire, sparks, and other particle effects."
 
 A particle emitter that looks like a fireball (`Fire.sks`) has already been added to this playground's **Resources** folder. The code below uses that particle emitter.
 
 - Experiment:
    Uncomment the blocks of code below.  Read through the code that's been uncommented. Then, run the playground to see the results.

//// Add a method to the CGFloat type that converts from degrees to radians
//// NOTE: Not strictly required, but makes it easier to think about how to rotate the particle emitter
//extension CGFloat {
//    func toRadians() -> CGFloat {
//        return self * CGFloat(Double.pi) / 180
//    }
//}
//
////// Create an instance of the 'SKParticleEmitter' Node at the right edge of the character's arm
//func generateFireball() {
//    
//    // Attempt to create an SKEmitterNode instance based on a file named "Fire.sks" (see Resources folder)
//    if let fireball = SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: "Fire") {
//        
//        // Create the fireball at the tip of the character's arm
//        fireball.position = CGPoint(x: character.position.x + 40, y: character.position.y + 27)
//        
//        // Make the fireball point to the right
//        let actionRotate = SKAction.rotate(byAngle: CGFloat(90).toRadians(), duration: 0)
//        fireball.run(actionRotate)
//        
//        // Add fireball to scene
//        scene.addChild(fireball)
//        
//        // Move the fireball
//        let actionMoveFireball = SKAction.moveTo(x: scene.size.width * 1.5, duration: 1.5)
//        fireball.run(actionMoveFireball)
//    }
//    
//}
//
//// Create an action that calls the `generateFireball` method
//let actionGenerateFireball = SKAction.run(generateFireball)
//
//// Modify the actions in the actionThrowFireBallThenWait sequence to include the fireball generation action
//actionThrowFireBallThenWait = SKAction.sequence([throwFireballAnimation, actionGenerateFireball, actionWaitASecond])
//
//// Re-set the throwFireBallRepeatedly action using the revised sequence from line 122
//throwFireBallRepeatedly = SKAction.repeatForever(actionThrowFireBallThenWait)
//
//// Remove all existing actions tied to this node
//// NOTE: This causes the character to disappear if the throwing fireball sequence is interrupted, so...
//character.removeAllActions()
//
//// ... re-set the character's image back to the starting texture
//let originalCharacterImage = SKTexture(imageNamed: "sf")
//let actionSetToOriginalTexture = SKAction.setTexture(originalCharacterImage)
//character.run(actionSetToOriginalTexture)
//
//// Add the revised actionThrowFireBallThenWait sequence and run repeatedly
//character.run(throwFireBallRepeatedly)

### About Particle Effects
 
 You can add, and configure, new particle files.
 
 To do this, two-finger tap on the **IntroToSpriteKit** folder in this project, then choose **New File**:
 
 ![new-file](new-file.png)
 
 In the sheet that appears, select the **macOS** tab, then **SpriteKit Particle File**:
 
 ![template-file-selection](template-file-selection.png)
 
 Then select whatever template suits your purposes – for now, select *Magic*, then press **Next**.
 
 On the final screen, choose a suitable file name – the default location is fine – then click **Create**:
 
 ![save-file](save-file.png)
 
 You will immediately be taken to a view that shows you the particle emitter with it's default settings.
 
 Show the **Inspectors** panel to adjust settings for the particle emitter:
 
 ![inspector](inspector.png)
 
 Experiment with the settings, but be sure to [also take a look at this document that explains the purpose of the various settings](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/11/7/special-effects-skemitternode) (be sure to scroll down a touch on the page to see the descriptions of what each setting does).
 
 Finally – but importantly – to use the particle emitter in a playground page – you'll need to copy it into the *Resources* folder. You can do this by holding down the **Option** key on your keyboard, then dragging up:
 
 ![option-drag](option-drag.png)
