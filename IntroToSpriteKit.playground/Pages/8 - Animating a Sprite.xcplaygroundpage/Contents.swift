 ## Animating a Sprite
 
 The code below sets up a basic scene with a black background.
 
 Read past this code section to learn how to animate a sprite to create the appearance of realistic movement.
 
 */

// Required frameworks
import PlaygroundSupport    // Allows playground to show live view
import SpriteKit            // Provides 2D graphics classes

// Define the animation size, scene, and scene color
let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 400, height: 300)
var scene = SKScene(size: frame.size)

// Define, configure, and present the scene
let view = SKView(frame: frame)
view.showsNodeCount = true
view.presentScene(scene)

// Show the view in the live view area
PlaygroundSupport.PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = view

// Add an edge-loop physics body around the scene, so that the hero doesn't fall off the bottom of the scene
scene.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(edgeLoopFrom: scene.frame)

// Draw a hero, with a physics body, in the bottom left corner
let hero = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "hero")
hero.position = CGPoint(x: hero.size.width / 2, y: hero.size.height / 2)
hero.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: hero.texture!,
                                 alphaThreshold: 0.5,
                                 size: hero.size)
scene.addChild(hero)

### Arrays

An [array](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html#ID107) is one of [three collection types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html) provided by Swift.
 
 An array is an *ordered* collection of values – in other words, a list.
 
 ![Array Example](Arrays_2x.png)
 
 *Image from [Swift Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html#ID107).*
 
 An array is very much like a string – something you're familiar with. As you know, a string is essentially a list of individual characters:
 
 ![String example](string-by-index.png)
 
 Sometimes it is convenient to refer to items when they are in a list.
 
 In this case, we need to use a list to refer to the images we'll use to animate a sprite walking.
 
 Why is that?
 
 Well – it's what the `SKAction` method that we want to use – [animate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skaction/1417656-animate) – expects:
 
 ![animate](animate-with.png)
 
 We can see that the first parameter, *with*, expects an argument that is an array of `SKTexture` objects. How? By the square brackets.
 
 When we see a type like `SKTexture`, that means a single instance of `SKTexture`.
 
 When we see a type like `[SKTexture]`, that means an *array* of `SKTexture` objects. In other words – look for the square brackets.
 
 For more details on what the `animate` method on `SKAction` expects, [read the developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skaction/1417656-animate) – it's very well written.
 
 So... long story short, our job is to create an array of the images we want to use to animate a video game hero moving to the right.
 
 If you expand this playground page and peek at the **Resources** subfolder, you'll see the two images we want to use:
 
 ![resources](resources.png)
 
 We want to create an array that looks like this:
 
 ![walking-images-array](walking_images_array.png)
 
 - Experiment:
 Uncomment the block of code below. This creates the array of images we need. Click the *Show Result* button at right, beside line 91. What do you see?
 
 ![show-result](show-result.png)
 
*/
//// Create an empty array of SKTexture objects
//var walkingTextures: [SKTexture] = []
//
//// Now add the two images we need in the array
//walkingTextures.append(SKTexture(imageNamed: "hero-walk-right-0"))
//walkingTextures.append(SKTexture(imageNamed: "hero-walk-right-1"))


/*:
 Animation on a computer is very much like animation in a "flipbook".
 
 "You draw a successive sequence of images, and when you flip through them fast enough, it gives the illusion of movement."
 
 ![flipbook](flipbook.png)
 
 *Excerpt and image from [2D Apple Games by Tutorials](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/2d-apple-games-by-tutorials).*
 
 That is exactly what we are now going to ask SpriteKit to do for us.

 - Experiment:
 Uncomment each block of code below. Run the playgrounds. What happens?
 
 */

//// Create an action to animate a walking motion using the hero sprites array (walkingTextures)
//let actionWalkingAnimation = SKAction.animate(with: walkingTextures, timePerFrame: 0.2, resize: true, restore: true)
//
//// Create an action that moves the hero forward a "step" where a step is 10 pixels
//// NOTE: The time interval for moving forward matches the time per frame of the animation
//let actionMoveForward = SKAction.moveBy(x: 10, y: 0, duration: 0.2)
//
//// Repeat the move forward action twice
//let actionMoveForwardTwice = SKAction.repeat(actionMoveForward, count: 2)
//
//// Now, combine the walking animation with the sprite moving forward
//let actionWalkAndMove = SKAction.group([actionWalkingAnimation, actionMoveForwardTwice])
//
//// Repeat the "walk and move" action five times
//let actionWalkAndMoveFiveTimes = SKAction.repeat(actionWalkAndMove, count: 5)
//
//// Make the hero walk and move forward five times
//hero.run(actionWalkAndMoveFiveTimes)

 ### Exercises
 
 Animate a rocket blasting off into space.
 
 If you open the **Resources** subfolder, you'll find a series of images to work with:
 
 ![rocket](rocket-images.png)
 
 These rocket images [are used with permission](http://newsletters.livecode.com/october/issue120/newsletter2.php?a=NWS120) and the [complete list of video and audio assets can be found here](http://www.runrev.com/downloads/galactic-gauntlet.zip).
 
 Make the following happen in order.
 
 1. Add a sprite based on the `rocket.png` file. Position the sprite on the right side of the scene, near the ground.
 2. Create an `[SKTexture]` array using the images named `rocket_0.png` to `rocket_5.png` from the **Resources** folder.
 3. Create an animation that will make the fireball below the rocket grow in size for second or two while the rocket remains stationary.
 4. Then, make the rocket "blast off" and move up on the screen. The image should show fire under the rocket (use `restore: false` when you create the animation in step 3).
